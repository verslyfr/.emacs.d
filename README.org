#+title: Emacs Configuration README

This repository contains my configuration for emacs. My approach for managing the configuration has continued to evolve. In the latest incarnation, it is just one large ~init.el~ file.

I am using the default package manager in emacs. I may need to change this decision at some point.

To use this repository, apply something like the following

#+begin_src shell
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/verslyfr/.emacs.d.git .emacs.d
cd .emacs.d
git clone https://github.com/fniessen/org-macros
#+end_src
