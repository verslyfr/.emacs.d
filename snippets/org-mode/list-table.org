# Column Groups
# 
# When Org exports tables, it does so by default without vertical lines because
# that is visually more satisfying in general.  Occasionally however, vertical
# lines can be useful to structure a table into groups of columns, much like
# horizontal lines can do for groups of rows.  In order to specify column
# groups, you can use a special row where the first field contains only ‘/’.
# The further fields can either contain ‘<’ to indicate that this column should
# start a group, ‘>’ to indicate the end of a column, or ‘<>’ (no space between
# ‘<’ and ‘>’) to make a column a group of its own.  Upon export, boundaries
# between column groups are marked with vertical lines.  Here is an example:
#
# Column Width and Alignment
#
#  If you would like to overrule the automatic alignment of number-rich
# columns to the right and of string-rich columns to the left, you can use
# ‘<r>’, ‘<c>’ or ‘<l>’ in a similar fashion.  You may also combine
# alignment and field width like this: ‘<r10>’.
